# Peanut Mold Detection Via Marker-based Watershed Segmentation and An Artificial Neural Network With Feedforward Backpropagation
Authors: Samuel Darwin D. Lagrosas and Prof. Lei Kristoffer R. Lactuan

Peanut seeds are susceptible to mold infestation such as Aspergillus, which causes the release of aflatoxins, a carcinogenic substance that can harm human and animal health. The aim of this study is to develop a method for detecting peanut mold using computer vision and artificial intelligence. Marker-based watershed segmentation was used to extract the peanut seeds from captured images for color and texture analysis. Color features are extracted from RGB, HSV, and Grayscale color spaces, while texture features are obtained using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix properties. Selected relevant features were fed into a feedforward backpropagation neural network, which generates values ranging from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating mold contamination and values near 0 indicating non-contamination. In detecting mold infestation in peanut seeds, the neural network produced an accuracy rate of 89.33%.
