## Submission details
Upload the necessary files at most two (2) days before your scheduled presentation. Consult regularly with your adviser to know if there are any specific requirements they might require. Notice that there is no `HOWTO.md` in the file structure above. This means that this file should be removed later before your presentation.

## `code` directory
This directory includes your source code as well as `SETUP.md` which contains the instruction for the development setup as well as how to access/install your work.

## `presentation` directory
This directory includes all materials which will be used during the presentation. Make sure to name your files by following this format: `CMSC<course code>_<initials>_<material>.<extension name>`. Replace those that are enclosed by angle brackets accordingly (e.g. `CMSC190_JDCRuz_journal.pdf`).
The `manuscript.pdf` and `poster.png` file may be added on a later date after you have presented your work.
The `videos.md` should include a link to a demo of your work. If you opt to do a prerecorded presentation, include it as well. The videos should be uploaded to YouTube or Google Drive. Make sure that these files have the proper access permissions.
For SP1 or Thesis Proposals, only the `journal.pdf` and `slides.pdf` are the minimum requirement for the submission.

## `CHANGELOGS.md`
This file contains the enrollment history for CMSC 190/200. Check the file in order to see an example.

## `README.md`
This file contains the title of your work, the authors, the abstract.
